### Best Practices for Secure Role-Based Access Control

#### 1. Principle of Least Privilege

Always give minimum necessary permissions to reduce the attack surface.

#### 2. Role Hierarchy

Organize roles from least to most privileged to reduce the chance of privilege escalation.

#### 3. Regular Audits

Review permissions periodically to detect potential privilege escalation.

#### 4. Test Thoroughly

Always test permissions before going to production to detect potential privilege escalation.

#### 5. Document Everything

Keep clear documentation of who can do what to track privilege escalation.

#### 6. Separate Concerns

Don't mix responsibilities in a single role to reduce the chance of privilege escalation.

#### 7. Disable Unused Accounts

Deactivate accounts when not needed to reduce the attack surface.

#### 8. Strong Passwords

Enforce password policies to reduce the chance of unauthorized access.
